# Compressed-Sensing-MRI

This is a University project carried out by me and my team (Victor Dobrev, Wallace Agyei and Dilini Kolambage) on "Compressed Sensing MRI", where we undersample the data from
k-space and use optimisation algorithms to extract near perfect MRI images from undersampled data.
